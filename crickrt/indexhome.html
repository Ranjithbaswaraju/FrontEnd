        <p>The International Cricket Council on Thursday (August 28) charged Sri Lanka spinner Praveen Jayawickrama for breaches of its anti-corruption code. The charges relate to the 25-year-old falling foul of three separate codes, in international cricket as well as the 2021 season of the Lanka Premier League.</p><br>

        <p>When Joel Wilson raised the finger to signal Kuldeep Yadav's dismissal, the R Premadasa Stadium in Colombo erupted with joy. Sri Lanka had won by a massive 110 runs and sealed the series 2-0. They had beaten India in a series for the first time in 27 years. Interim head coach Sanath Jayasuriya was cock-a-hoop with the achievement and could not stop smiling during his post match interview with the official broadcaster.
            Having lost the T20I series 3-0 in Kandy, a host of injury problems in their pace attack, and up against the No.1 ODI team, Sri Lanka came into the series as underdogs. Jayasuriya was proud of how his young team fought back in Colombo despite a host of challenges in the lead-up to the series.
            "It was a very long wait because that series I played in 1997 and got a lot of runs in that series. That was the last series we won against India. After 27 years, I am part of the team and I am very happy to be part of these boys. They are a very nice bunch of players and are talented and the whole country would have seen what we can do.
            "The boys went through a very, very hard time. Even during the T20 series we played well but the result was not what was expected. The players realised what went wrong when we came back to Colombo and they started to play well.", he continued.</p><br>

        <p>The Afghanistan Cricket Board on Wednesday (August 7) handed out a five-year ban from 'all forms of cricket activities' to Ihsanullah Janat for his breaches of the ACB and ICC anti-corruption code during this year's Kabul Premier League. The 26-year-old batter, who last represented the national team in 2022, admitted to charges and confessed to his involvement in corrupt activities.

            "Janat was found guilty of violating Article 2.1.1 of the ICC Anti-Corruption Code, which involves improper influence or efforts to fix the result, progress, conduct, or any other aspect of a match," the ACB said in a statement. "In light of this violation, he has been handed a five-year ban from all cricket-related activities."</p><br>
