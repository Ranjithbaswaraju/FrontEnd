        <p>Francis Galton was a shirttail relative of Charles Darwin. Galton did a study of successful people in the 19th century, and he concluded that there are three things that make people successful: ability, zeal and the capability to work hard. Cousin Darwin was surprised that talent even made the list — he knew perseverance was much more important. In Darwin’s opinion, most people are mostly alike. Differences in intelligence and talent simply aren’t great enough between people to account for the wide disparity in individual success. Not only was Darwin a big achiever himself, plenty of biographical information exists to illustrate that he was the sort who persevered.
            If you ask around, people will say that effort is more important than talent, yet many are awed by supposed naturals and their gifts. It is a hidden prejudice, being biased for talent over effort. And when we believe that someone is talented, we tend to shower them with attention — and we expect more from them. These things help people achieve more, so it’s a self-fulfilling prophecy.
            Duckworth used to work at McKinsey. During her tenure there, she describes doing a lot of work that companies had to contract out because they didn’t have time to do it themselves. But people also hired McKinsey because the consultants were known to be smart. (Companies try to hire the most talented and fire the least talented.) When you crunch the numbers, though, the companies that hired McKinsey consultants didn’t do any better than if they tried to solve their problems in-house — in fact, they often did worse.
            Enron prioritized talent; they were hailed as being innovative. But they failed due to massive accounting fraud. Many good people who themselves had no hand in the wrongdoing lost their jobs. The problem was that everybody on the planet knew how smart they were, including themselves. Company culture became narcissistic and smug — but insecure, also, so they had to keep showing off. Short term performance was prioritized over long term learning. The company fired the lowest performing 15% of employees every year, which encouraged widespread deception, as people were desperate to avoid the cut.
            Talent isn’t a bad thing by any means, but it isn’t the only, or most important, thing. It is simply one factor of many. And putting so much attention on talent disvalues everything else.
