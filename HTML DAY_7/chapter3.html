        <p>When people achieve something, we label them “talented,” but talent really isn’t extraordinary. In fact, it’s sort of common and mundane. We say it’s a gift and the person is a natural, just because we can’t fathom that greatness is doable. Greatness is composed of multiple individual accomplishments — they are all doable
            We want the process to be mysterious. We want it to be magic. We don’t want to know how Olympic swimmer Mark Spitz got to be so good — that way we don’t feel so bad about not replicating his achievements. Mythologizing talent means we don’t qualify anyway, so we might as well relax and not try so hard. And Nietzsche agrees with us. Greatness happens when people strive in one direction, when they use everything available to them, when they are awesome observers who look at everything as potential models and never stop trying. Nietzsche is not so much into talent. Sure, people might be gifted, but they don’t achieve greatness without great effort.
            Talent + effort = skill. And skill x effort = achievement. Effort counts twice — it builds skill and it makes skills productive. After doing something repeatedly, no matter how hard it is, it becomes easy. But people give up. They knit incomplete sweaters, write incomplete novels, don’t stick with diets. They give up. Strivers, on the other hand, improve their skill so that they are better than the talented who are complacent. It takes people a long time to develop expertise. This is one reason why perseverance is important. You have to stick with one thing for a long time to get really, really good at it.
